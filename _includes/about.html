			Hi, I'm {{ site.author.name }}!
		</h3>
		<p>
			I am a Senior Principal Software Engineer at Amazon Web Services (AWS),
			where I work on developer tooling and agentic AI.
			I focus on Kiro and Strands Agents SDK.
		</p>
		<p>
			Throughout my 10+ years at Amazon, my objective has been delighting developers on AWS.
			Prior to working on agentic AI for developers, I worked on AWS Proton, Amazon ECS, and the AWS Code Suite,
			as well as several open source projects including AWS CDK, Spinnaker, and Backstage.
			Before joining Amazon in 2014, I was a software engineer at Motorola Solutions
			working on products in the WiFi technology space. I graduated from the University
			of Texas at Austin with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
